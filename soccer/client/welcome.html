This program on Saturdays consists of a 15 minute training session, followed by a small sided game that lasts the rest of the session. Coaches monitor the kids, keep the teams balanced and provide individual coaching to kids as they play. On Sundays the kids play in a Futsal environment, typically coaches, parents and sometimes local players, will participate on the field helping the kids learn positioning, passing and new skills while playing the game. The program is offered again in the fall, if there is sufficient demand, we will continue the program through the summer months.

              <p>This program runs from early Spring. The Sunday sessions are at the Athens High School Turf field. Kids must wear shin guards covered with socks, and soccer cleats are highly recommended. Skilled youth players are welcome to join the faster paced game with adults, or they can play in the slower paced family Futsal environment with the kids aged 6-12. The Sunday futsal program is great for kids who play other sports and still want to play soccer, or for kids involved in travel / rec soccer who want to build up their skills and experience. The times and availability of this program are subject to change based around the Athens High School use of the Turf field and availability of the Futsal volunteers to setup and tear down the playing area.</p>
