       Youth players must be a member of Athens Community Soccer in order to be eligible to play. Membership runs January to December, and costs $20 per player. In order to
       qualify for youth membership, a player must be at least 3 years of age and under 18. Our Youth program is designed to provide kids with a positive soccer experience,
       every kid gets to participate and play equally, regardless of skill level. Our volunteer coaching staff are usually experienced soccer players who will try to group
       kids together in a fair and balanced manner. Our goal is to give kids the opportunity to play soccer in a safe and fun environment. To sign your child up, simply
       create a parent account using our sign up for soccer form on our website, then log in and add each child using the dashboard. The membership fee of $20 is the only cost
       involved and youth players can participate in both Saturday and Sunday sessions in the Spring and Fall.

       This program runs from April 26th until June 15th. Saturday sessions are at the Athens Soccer Complex (by Walmart), and Sunday sessions are at the Athens High School Turf Field.
       Kids must wear shin guards covered with socks, but soccer cleats are optional. This program consists of a short warm up, the monsters game, a new game/activity and wraps up with small sided soccer games, usually 3v3. The Saturday and Sunday sessions are the same each week. We adapt the <a href="http://www.saysoccer.org">SAY Soccer</a> activities so that they are suitable for this younger age group. The focus of the program is to get the kids
       comfortable with the ball and to build their confidence while having fun. The program is offered again in the fall, usually in early August to early October.

       small sided game that lasts the rest of the session. Coaches monitor the kids, keep the teams balanced and provide individual coaching to kids as they play. On Sundays
       the kids play in a Futsal environment, typically coaches, parents and sometimes local players, will participate on the field helping the kids learn positioning, passing
       and new skills while playing the game. The program is offered again in the fall, if there is sufficient demand, we will continue the program through the summer months.

       This program runs from early Spring. The Sunday sessions are at the Athens High School Turf field. Kids must wear shin guards covered with socks, and soccer cleats are
       highly recommended. Skilled youth players are welcome to join the faster paced game with adults, or they can play in the slower paced family Futsal environment with the
       kids aged 6-12. The Sunday futsal program is great for kids who play other sports and still want to play soccer, or for kids involved in travel / rec soccer who want
       to build up their skills and experience. The times and availability of this program are subject to change based around the Athens High School use of the Turf field and
       availability of the Futsal volunteers to setup and tear down the playing area.

       Futsal is very similar to soccer, but is played with a slightly heavier ball and has a focus on footwork and passing. Futsal is currently offered on Sundays at the
       Athens High School Turf Football Field in The Plains. Futsal is a casual and fun recreational environment, similar to League 2. Unlike League 1 and League 2, Futsal
       has no assigned teams, players are assigned to a team / game as they show up. Futsal typically has a kids/family game and one or more slightly faster paced adult games. It is played with no goal keepers and smaller Futsal goals. There are no referee fees for Sunday Futsal. Sign-in and check the schedule for other indoor futsal options
       on weekdays.
